# Backward Compatibility

## Client v1 to Server v2

Once you upgrade your from version 1 to version 2, you may still have a production application which still make use of the client DLLs of version 1. For the most part, the client of version 1 is compatible with server 2, expect for the following cases:

* **Facets:**	the implementation of facets was change is version 2, and it's not compatible with the Client v1.

So if you do not use facets in your application, yo do not need to upgrade all of you applications to use the v2 of the client. The v1 of the client should be working fine the v2 of the server.
